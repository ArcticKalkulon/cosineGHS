# cosineGHS
A Python implementation of the Generalized Harvey-Shack rough surface scattering method using discrete ordinates.
(The code also contains a Python implementation of the discrete Hankel transform)


The code is described in more detail in the following paper:
```
 Villads Egede Johansen, Preparing the generalized Harveyâ€“Shack rough surface scattering method for use with the discrete ordinates method, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, 3(2), 186-94 (2015)
```
on which a preprint version is available in the repo as well (correctedManuscript.pdf).


# Running the code
To test the code use Python2 or Python3 to call
```
python cosineHarveyShack.py
```
